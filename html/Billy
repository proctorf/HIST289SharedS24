                     <p>Twenty Dollars Reward</p>
                     
                     <p>Ran away from the subscriber living in Pendleton county, state of Kentucky, near the
                        folks of licking, on the 11th of October last, a negro man named Billy, about 37 or
                        38 years old, of a rather low stature, well set and strong built, had his head generally
                        neatly combed and his carlocks plated or twisted, which he sometimes tied together
                        at the back of his head, and sometimes let them hang down, which was remarkable in
                        a black negro as he is, though his complexion is none of the blackest. As to his clothing
                        he had on when he went away a coarse linsey coat, two shirt and two overalls, and
                        a fur hat about half worn- he had other clothing which he took away, viz. a new coat
                        jacket and breeches of flax and cotton of a pale blue color. But as he is a cunning,
                        artful villain, it is probable that he has changed his clothing and cut his hair.
                        It is also probable that he may have a forged pass; as there are white men mean enough
                        to forge the like; and sometimes I think he eloped with and under the protection of
                        some white villains as his owner. If stripped; his back will show visible marks of
                        the whip. It is likely too he may attempt to pass as a free man, as he is a tolerable
                        good rough carpenter and house joiner- Whoever secures him for me so that I get him,
                        either by bringing him to me, or putting him in some public jail, shall recieve the
                        above reward.</p>
