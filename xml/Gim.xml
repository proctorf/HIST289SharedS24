            RANAWAY from the subscriber, on <date dateType="lastSeen">Saturday the 2d day of March last</date>, 
            A Negro Man, named 
            <name xml:id="">GIM</name>;
            About 23 years of age, 5 feet 11 inches high, somewhat slender, and not very black; 
            he is about a chesnut color: with a small ear upon one of his cheeks; I believe his right cheek; 
            
            he made from <place placeType ="departure">Winchester, Va</place> to <place>Pittsburgh</place>, and from thence to <place placeType="location last seen">Steubenville</place>, 
            where I come up with him on the <date dateType="lastSeen">7th inst.</date> and though I have heard of him in said place twice, I am not able to get him. 
            from his being harbor’d or conceal’d in or about said place–this is to forewarn all persons in the <place placeType="potential destination">state of Ohio</place>, 
            from hiring or harboring said negro, without his producing proper credentials, according to law, 
            under the penalty of their lives– for I am determined to risk mine in defence of my property; 
            and the consequences may be serious with any man, who should see proper to hire or harbor said fellow after this notice. 
            Said fellow is a pretty good blacksmith, and it is probable he will apply to work in that line.
            
            The above reward will be given to any person. who will secure said negro in any jail in the State of Ohio,
            on giving notice to the subscriber, by letter, at <place placeType="pubPlace">Front Royal, Frederick Co. Va. </place>
