            Ranaway from the subscriber, living in <place placeType="origin">Scott county, Kentucky</place>, 
            a negro man by the name of <name xml:id="">DENNIS</name>,
            about twenty seven years of age, about five feet ten or eleven inches high, stout and well made, 
            of a yellow complexion, has lost the sight of the left eye, is very talkative and impudent–
            he left <place placeType="location last seen">Georgtown</place> on the <date>15th inst.</date> And was seen on the <date>17th</date>, near the house of James Theobalds, on the dry Ridge, 
            making towards <place>Cincinnati</place>, in company with a white man–it is uncertain what dress he had on, 
            as he probably change it often–he has probably a certificate from the clerk of the Harrison Circuit Court, 
            where he formerly had a suit depending, in which he had set up a claim for his freedom; 
            The certificate was allowing him the privilege of making the necessary preparation for the trial of his suit; 
            but it is dated several years back. 
            
            The above reward will be given to any person that will bring said slave and deliver him to the subscriber, 
            or for confining him in the jail of Scott county, so that I get him again, if taken in this state
            
            –and the further sum of fifty dollars, if taken out of the state.

            N.B. If he is taken, it will be necessary for him to be well secured, 
            otherwise he will make escape, as he is very strong and artful.     H.E.
