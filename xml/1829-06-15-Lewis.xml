            About 32 or 33 years of age, about 5 feet 6 or 7 inches high, of a mild voice, and apt to look down when spoken to; his complexion is of a dark brown color; took with him a dark janes coat and an old blue cloth coat, and several different kinds of pantaloons, a plaid cloak, lined with green baize, and a fur hat. He stole and took with him a large Sorrel Horse, a few white hairs in his forehead, trots and paces well, mane wore off on the top of his neck; he has a mark little above his nose; the mark has the appearance as if he had been doctored for the big head.--it is probable he may have obtained a pass or have been conducted by some white man.
