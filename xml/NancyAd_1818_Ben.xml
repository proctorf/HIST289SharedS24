        <p>100 DOLLARS REWARD</p>
        <p>Ranaway from the subscriber, in <place ref = "Mayslick, KY" placeType="origin">Mayslick, KY</place>, on the
            <date dateType="departure" when="1818-06-30"> 30th of June last </date> a Negro Man named</p>

            </name>
        </p>
        <p>, He is about 23 years of age, supposed to be about 5 feet and 11 inches high, stout made and well proportioned-of
            a dark complexion: no other marks recollected. He is very bold, and will him a small Bay Horse, saddle, and bridle,
            which he disposed of on White oak Creek, Ohio, and then stole them again: and, on Saturday last, sold them in Cincinnati.
            He has since been seen on the road leading to<place
                placeType="destination">Urbana</place>. 
            Had on when he went away, a pair of tow linen pantaloons, cloth coat, and roram hat, but, having a pair of nankeen 
            pantaloons, and a gingham roundabout with him, it is expected he will change his clothing. 
            The above reward of One Hundred Dollars will be given if taken any where out of Kentucky, and all reasonable charges
            paid if brought home and Twenty-Five Dollars if taken within the state of Kentucky.
