    <transcript>$300 Reward.
        
        Runaway from December last, a Negro Man named MOSES, about six feet high, 
        well formed, black, abont forty years of age, is fond of spirituons liquors, 
        and when under its influence stutters a little. He took with him a new jeans coat, 
        and another of blue cloth, considerably worn, a white fur hat, pretty well worn, 
        and blue jeans pantaloons. He rode away a large bay horse, belonging to Mr Tho’s H Waters, 
        of Lexington, about 16 hands high, heavy made, paces and trots, 
        and has a scar (or sore) near the point of his shoulder, 
        occasioned by cutting out a warf. 
        Said Negro has worked upon Lexington and Maysville Turnpike for some time past, 
        in the employ of Mr Waters. The above reward of Three Hundred Dollars, 
        will be given for him if taken out of the State; fifty dollars if 
        in the State and out of the counties of Fayette or Bourbon; 
        or Twenty-five dollars if in either those counties.

        P.S. It is supposed that Moses is in company with a fellow named Bill, 
        belonging to a Mr Johnson of Shelby county, but late of Bourbon. 
        Bill Is a short, stout built negro. A liberal reward, as I learn, 
        is offered for Bill by his Master</transcript>
