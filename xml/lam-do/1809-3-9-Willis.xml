            <place placeType="origin">Shanandoah county, Virginia,</place> 
            on the <date dateType="departure" when="1807-06-06">6th of June 1807</date>, 
            a Negro man by the name of <name xml:id="">Willis</name>, 
            about 25 or 26 years of age, yellow complexion, slow of speech, 
            and when standing his knees incline back, he took with 
            him a gun and watch, and was pursued all most to Marietta 
            on the Ohio – had with him a Pass that called him Wills 
            or Willis – he said he was going to the State of Ohio, 
            and was freed by a Methodist preacher. Any person who will 
            take up said Negro, and lodge him in Cincinnati Jail, 
            shall have the above reward and all reasonable charges paid by me.
