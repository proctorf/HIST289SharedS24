            the 9th inst. about five miles below <place placeType="origin">Law-
            enceburg</place>, from a boat on the passage
            up from Orleans, a negro boy named
            <name xml:id=""><hi rend="allCaps">DAVID</hi></name>,
            about 16 or 17 years old, 5 feet 5 or 6
            inches high, and very active; just above
            the right breast are two lumps or scars,
            supposed to be done with the whip, and
            two similar scars on the back of the
            neck, and two scars on the left breast,
            one very plain, the other not quite so
            plain. When he laughs, his eye-teeth
            project almost out of his mouth. He has
            a large flat nose, and very impudent
            look. The hair on his head is very thin,
            so that the skin is seen in streaks thro'
            the hair. He speaks English, and in-
            different French. The above rewars
            and reasonable charges will be given to
            any person apprehending and delivering
            him to the subscriber, or confining him
            in any way so that he may be had again.
