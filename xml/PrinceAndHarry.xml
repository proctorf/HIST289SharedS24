            RANAWAY from my farm, within 5 miles of <place placeType="origin">Louisville</place>, on the <date dateType="departure" when="1814-05-04">4th inst</date> two NEGRO MEN– named <name xml:id="">Prince</name> and <name xml:id="">Harry</name>, 
            PRINCE is about 5 feet 6 or 8 inches high, well set for his height, 
            about 30 years old, a little dingy with a yellowish cast; he has lost on of his fore-teeth, 
            or there is a small gap between his teeth, I do not know which, 
            and I think a smaller gap between his under fore-teeth; he has a tolerable good countenance only. 
            His clothing not recollected. 
            
            HARRY, who sometimes calls himself King, is about the same age, but not so tall by 2 or 3 inches perhaps, 
            more delicate made, looks quite black and sleek, has large white eyes for a negro, 
            speaks fierce and free when spoken to, and is a smart sensible fellow to converse with.
            
            These negroes are at this time in the neighborhood of <place placeType="location last seen">Georgetown, Ky</place>–
            they have been seen a day or two past at Mr. Adam Pense’s and at old Mr. Emmerson’s, on Dry-run; 
            they intend to start in a few days for <place placeType="potential destination">Cincinnati</place>, as I am informed–from that place they intend to make their way thro the state of <place placeType="potential destination">Ohio</place>, and up the Ohio, and so on to <place placeType="potential destination">Maryland</place>. 
            Any person delivering said negroes to me at my farm, shall receive the above reward and reasonable expenses, or fifty dollars for either of them.

            N.N It was their intention to have went up the Ohio to Cincinnati, 
            when they left home; but afterwards turned their course by Georgetown, 
            as Harry formerly lived in that neighborhood.                    D.L.W.
