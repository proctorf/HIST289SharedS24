        <p>Fifty Dollar Reward</p>
        <p>Eloped from my <place ref = "#Davidson, TN" placeType="origin">plantation on Cumberland river</place>, on the
                <date dateType="departure" when="1802-05-23">23d inst.</date> a negro man slave,

            </name>
        </p>
        <p>Yellow complexion, about 6 feet high, 30 years of age, stout made, and very active. Talks
            sensibly, and flops a little in his walk; had on when he went a way a pair of lea- ther
            overalls, and a hunting shirt filled with black wool _ I have no doubt but he will pass
            for a free man, and perhaps produce a pass, as heretofore a free fellow of the name
            Brown, forged him a pass, by the name of George Velvin, and signed Thomas Hutchings, and
            6 residing justices of Davidson court, thereto; he will make for the <place
                placeType="destination">Western Territory</place>, or <place placeType="destination"
                >Detroit</place>; he has obtained by some means a good idea of the Geography of that
            country; if apprehended he is artful and will make his escape, unless well secured - any
            person that will bring him to me, or lodge him in some jail shall receive the above
            reward. </p>
