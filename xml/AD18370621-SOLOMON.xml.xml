        <p>Two Hundred dollars Reward. </p>
        
        <p>Stop the thief! Runaway from the subscriberâ€™s farm near <place placeType="origin">Lexington Ky.</place> on the 14th instant a Negro man named <name xml:id="">Solomon</name> about five foot nine or ten inches height about 30 years old a dark Mulatto or rather yellow or what is sometimes called Mahogany color; no particular marks remembered. He has a rather pleasant countenance but something of a downward look not generally looking those in the face to whom he is speaking; his cheeks show dimples when he smiles. He stole and rode off a bay mare about fifteen and a half hands high six or seven years old a natural pacer no white spots recalled except those made by the collar which are considerable; shod all round. He has probably made for <place placeType="potential destination">Canada</place>.</p>
        
        <p>The above reward of two hundred dollars will be given for the Negro, if taken out of the State: or fifty dollars if taken within the State, and $20 for the horse. Confinement of the Thief in some jail where I can get him, will entitle that taker to the reward, and if he be brought to me, the reascusable expense of bringing him shall be paid.</p>
