            Ran away from the subscriber, on 
            <date when="1829-10-09" dateType="departure">Saturday evening, the 9th inst.
            </date>
            a <hi rend="allCaps">negro man</hi> slave named

            </name>
            , aged about 35 or 36 years, five feet eight inches high, or thereabout. Said slave is very black, with white teeth, a pleasing countenance, very talkative to those he is acquainted with, but reserved to strangers; is fond of making use of high-sounding words; will deny stoutly being a runaway, but can be easily found out by being cross-questioned, where he is from, whom he knows, &amp;c. When he went away he had on tow linen pantaloons, flax linen shirt, and probably took pantaloons of good quality, one dimity, and one blue cassimere vest.

        <p>
            A reward of $20 will be given for the apprehension and delivery of said slave to me in 
            <place placeType="pubPlace">Lexington
            </place>
            , if taken out of the state, or $10 if taken in the state, and all reasonable expenses paid, or the above mentioned reward paid if secured in any jail so that I can get him again.
